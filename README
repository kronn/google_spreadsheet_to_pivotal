As a developer
I want to integrate Pivotal and GoogleSpreadsheets
In order to move priotized work units into my current sprint

Our ProductOwner uses Google Docs (Spreadsheets, specifically) to work with the
product backlog. One Spreadsheets contains the prioritized stories. Currently,
it's copy and paste. I want to drag and drop.

== INSTALL

1. Grab a copy of the source

    git clone git://github.com/kronn/google_spreadsheet_to_pivotal.git

2. Create a Heroku app

    heroku create myapp

3. Set some heroku vars

    # username and password of the user who can access (at least read) the spreadsheet

    heroku config:add SPREADSHEET_USERNAME=someone@googlemail.com SPREADSHEET_PASSWORD=password

    # First worksheet of http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg&hl=en

    heroku config:add SPREADSHEET_KEY="pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg"

    # Mapping of fields

    heroku config:add SPREADSHEET_MAPPING='id-slug-name--estimate'

    # You can leave the requestor blank, if you like.

    heroku config:add SPREADSHEET_REQUESTOR="John Smith"

4. Pick a username and a passswordfor Pivotal to use

    heroku config:add HTTP_BASIC_USERNAME=pivotal HTTP_BASIC_PASSWORD=password

5. Deploy to Heroku

    git push heroku master

6. Test you're getting XML back

    open http://myapp.heroku.com/

7. Add the integration to Pivotal. From the "Configure Integrations" page, add an "Other" integration.

    * **Name:** Product Backlog
    * **Basic Auth username:** What you picked for HTTP_BASIC_USERNAME
    * **Basic Auth password:** What you picked for HTTP_BASIC_PASSWORD
    * **Base URL:** hmm.
    * **Import API URL:** http://myapp.heroku.com/
    * **Active: Yes**

12. From the "More" menu of Pivotal Tracker you should see "Product Backlog"

13. Buy me a beer.
