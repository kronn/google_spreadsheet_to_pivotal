As a developer
I want to integrate Pivotal and GoogleSpreadsheets
In order to move priotized work units into my current sprint

Our ProductOwner uses Google Docs (Spreadsheets, specifically) to work with the
product backlog. One Spreadsheets contains the prioritized stories. Currently,
it's copy and paste. I want to drag and drop.
