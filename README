As a developer
I want to integrate Pivotal and GoogleSpreadsheets
In order to move priotized work units into my current sprint

Our ProductOwner uses Google Docs (Spreadsheets, specifically) to work with the
product backlog. One Spreadsheets contains the prioritized stories. Currently,
it's copy and paste. I want to drag and drop. Even better, I want him to do that.

== INSTALL

1. Grab a copy of the source

    git clone git://github.com/kronn/google_spreadsheet_to_pivotal.git

2. Set everything up

    bundle install
    rake setup

    This installs the dependencies, creates a heroku app and updates the
    configuration.

    If you really read the README first and don't have a configuration-file
     yet, rake will provide further instructions.

    If everything worked, you get the information about how to setup the 
    integration in the pivotal tracker.

== CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

```
spreadsheet:
  username: "someone@googlemail.com"
  password: "password"
  key: "pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg"
  mapping: "id-name-description-estimate"
  requestor: "Product Owner"

http_basic:
  username: "pivotal"
  password: "password"
```

=== SPREADSHEET

==== USERNAME/PASSWORD
username and password are the access-credentials of a user who can access (at
least read) the spreadsheet

==== KEY
the key is taken from the url of the spreadsheet in question

in http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg&hl=en
the key would be "pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg"

==== Mapping of fields

"id-name-description-estimate" maps the given columns to the respective values
in the xml delivered to pivotal. column names are separated by a -, so you can
skip a column if you add more dashes.

==== REQUESTOR

You can leave the requestor blank, if you like.

=== HTTP_BASIC

Pick a username and a passswordfor Pivotal to use

== AUTHENTICATION PROBLEMS

If you exprience a crashed app, the underlying cause might be that you need to
enter a captcha. The app cannot do that. You can however log in manually and
thereby satisfy the captcha-requirement. Google remembers that for a while.
